	Description: My 2017 default theme is clean, CV-Portfolio, and designed for clarity, straightforward typography is readable on a wide variety of screen sizes, and suitable for multiple languages. I designed it using a mobile-first approach, meaning your content takes center-stage, regardless of whether your visitors arrive by smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer.
