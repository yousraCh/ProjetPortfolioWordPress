Wordfence Assistant provides data management utilities for Wordfence users.  

== Description ==

Wordfence Assistant provides data management utilities for Wordfence users. 
You can use Wordfence Assistant to:

* Disable the Wordfence firewall without having the Wordfence plugin active.
* Delete all Wordfence data in your database.
* Purge the Wordfence Live Traffic Table.
* Delete all locked out users, IP addresses and advanced locks.

If you have been locked out of your WordPress installation, we provide a user-friendly way to unlock
your site by sending an unlock email to the site administrator's email address. Occasionally this does
not work which is why we created this plugin. In this case, you will need to delete the Wordfence files
from the /wp-content/plugins/wordfence/ directory. Once you've done that, install this plugin and 
use it to disable the Wordfence firewall. You can then safely reenable Wordfence and adjust the configuration
to avoid getting locked out again. Make sure you update your administrator email address to that you 
can use the user-friendly email unlock feature if you lock yourself out of your site in future. 

== Installation ==

To install Wordfence assistant, simply install it as you would any other WordPress plugin.
Once installed you'll see a "WF Assistant" menu on the left side of your administrative interface.
If you click the menu option the data management options are self explanatory.
